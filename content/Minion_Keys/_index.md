<h1 style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Overview</h1>

The Minion Keys workspace is used to manage minion keys. A minion key allows encrypted communication between a Salt Master and Salt minion. The workspace provides an overview of all minions filtered by their respective key states. On initial connection, a Salt minion sends its public key to the Salt Master, which the Salt Master can accept, reject, or deny.
