SaltStack SecOps Vulnerability supports importing security scans generated by a variety of third-party vendors. In the connectors workspace you can configure setting to import scan results from a connector. SaltStack SecOps currently includes a connector integration with Tennable.io.<br>
<br>
Once configured, a connector allows you to import vulnerability scan results from Tenable.io into SaltStack SecOps. Then, in addition to remediating vulnerabilities, SaltStack SecOps also exports asset data into Tenable.io.

<h1 style="color:black;font-size:20px;">How to Use the Connector</h1>
<br>
To import vulnerabilities through a connector, first configure your connector by providing the third partyâ€™s API keys. Once you have saved your connector, go to SaltStack SecOps Vulnerability to import your scan results to a vulnerability policy.
