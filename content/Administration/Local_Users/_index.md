Local users are users whose username and password are natively stored in SaltStack Config. You can manage local user settings, such as user passwords, in the SaltStack Config user interface. If your organization uses a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory server, you could manage those user settings in LDAP and then synchronize those settings in SaltStack Config.<br>
<br>
Whether a user is local, or synchronized from an LDAP connection, you can manage the user’s roles and permissions within the user interface using SaltStack Config’s Role Based Access Control (RBAC).<br>
