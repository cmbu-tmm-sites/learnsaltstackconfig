Welcome to the Minions Page

{{< img src="/Minions/mainminions.png" alt="MinionsView" >}}

<h1 style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Overview</h1>

This page is where you will manage your minions and put them into Target groups.The Minions workspace is used to:

- View minion details
- Run ad-hoc jobs or commands
- Create and save new targets
- Adjust target settings, such as attached pillars
- Search for a minion or sort minions based on their minion ID or other system properties       (referred to as grains)
- Managing minions and targets

The Minions workspace includes a list of all Salt minions that are running the minion service and that are currently managed by SaltStack Config. Minions are nodes running the minion service, which can listen to commands from a Salt controller and perform the requested tasks. Salt Masters can themselves run the minion service, which makes it possible to configure and manage the node running the Salt controller service as needed. A good example of treating the Salt Master like a minion could be something like pushing config files down to the master.d directory.

The side panel of the workspace includes a list of targets. A target is the group of minions, across one or many Salt controllers, that a jobâ€™s Salt command applies to. A Salt controller can also be managed like a minion and can be a target if it is running the minion service. Defining a target for a job or operation also prevents the operation from running on nodes that should not run that operation. Targets can contain minions that are connected to any Salt controller in your environment. You can attach pillar data to different targets. Pillars are structures of data defined on the Salt controller and passed through to one or more minions, using targets. They allow confidential, targeted data to be securely sent only to the relevant minion. 

By default, when you open the workspace, the All Minions target is active. The All Minions target lists all the minions you have permission to access.
