Completed Activity section can be used to monitor the status of completed jobs or activities. You can view the return data from the executed jobs by clicking on the JID link in the associated jobs column. When you click on the JID you will be presented with the return data in a couple of different formats. If you did a state.apply for instance you will see highdata being returned.

There is also a way to view the Raw JSON response. This can be helpful in troubleshooting and/or looking at what happened on the Event Bus.
