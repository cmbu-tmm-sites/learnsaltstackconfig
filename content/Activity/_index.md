Welcome to the Activity Page

<h1 style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Overview</h1>

The Activity workspace is used to monitor the status of jobs and other activities. The Activity workspace gives visibility to many types of events and activities, such as:

- Scheduled jobs
- Ad-hoc jobs
- Compliance or vulnerability assessments

The Activity workspace has three sections that sort jobs or other activities by status:

- <u>[Completed](/Activity/Completed)</u>
- <u>[In_Progress](/Activity/In_Progress)</u>
- <u>[Upcoming](/Activity/Upcoming)</u>

The table in each section shows information about the latest jobs or activities and events, such as the eventâ€™s status, origin, schedule (if available), job, target information, and more. You can customize which columns are displayed as needed. 

Jobs and other activities move from In Progress to Completed when all associated nodes have finished reporting.
