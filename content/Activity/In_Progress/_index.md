The In Progress page allows you to monitor the status of jobs that are currently running. There are various stages in which you might see the job status, some of those are:

<b>Running</b> - the job or activity is currently running<br>
<b>Paused</b> - the job or activity has been paused by the User<br>
<b>Queued</b> - the job or activity is attempting to start running<br>
<b>Stopping</b> - the job or activity is looking for an opportunity to stop<br>

If you click on the JID for a job that is in the In Progress section then you will not see return data yet.
