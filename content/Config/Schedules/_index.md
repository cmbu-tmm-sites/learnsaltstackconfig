Schedules are used to automate job execution. You can use this workspace to:

* Schedule one-off or recurring jobs to monitor your environment
* Run jobs continuously at any time
* Disable schedules and skip jobs
* Run a scheduled job

SaltStack Config includes a range of scheduling options, allowing you to build custom schedules. 

By going to Config-->Schedules and Click Create Schedule and then fill in the form.
